# Noobot
Noobot is a SlackBot for C# built on the intention of extensibility; building a bot should be fun.

## About
I wanted to build a bot host/framework that was easy to work with, but also has the potential of being super powerful. 

Noobot supports DI out of the box for all custom elements to ensure all elements could be easily tested and predictable. 

## Setup
Please note that you will need to create a config.json file with your bot's api key. This should live under:
`src/Noobot.Runner/Configuration`

Read how to get Noobot up and running quickly on the [wiki](https://github.com/noobot/noobot/wiki/Getting-Started-With-Noobot#get-noobot-up-and-running-quickly).
